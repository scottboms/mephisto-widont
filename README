MephistoWidont
==============

A Widon't plugin for the Mephisto blogging package based on an idea from Shaun Inman and a Rails helper provided by mucur.name (sorry, don't know the author's actual name).

For more information on Widon't, see this post: http://shauninman.com/archive/2006/08/22/widont_wordpress_plugin

INSTALLATION
------------
Install as you would any regular plugin:

ruby script/install http://svn.wishingline.com/mephisto_widont


USING THE PLUGIN
-----------------
The plugin introduces a new Liquid text filter tag that you can use to prevent widows in things such as post titles or pretty much anywhere that these sort of filters are accepted or make sense.

{{ article.title | widont }}
